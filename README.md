# Hotelbooking APP
This is the backend of our capstone project such as aHotel Booking App

## How to run? :thinking:

Open the backend folder and run the following command

```
npm install
```

And Node Packages install with the name `node_modules` and after you need to run the following command

```
npm start
```

then happily run on localhost with 
`localhost:8800`
